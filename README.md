# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Government-Released-Policies

The sentiment analysis model developed in this mini-project allows us to gain insights into public sentiment towards government policies. 
By following the machine learning lifecycle, we can effectively collect, preprocess, model, evaluate, and report on the sentiments expressed 
by the public, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions and improve governance.
The project shows the insights gained from public sentiment regarding government policies, including positive and negative sentiments, trends, and potential areas of improvement.
